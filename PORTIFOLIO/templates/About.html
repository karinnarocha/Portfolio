      Hi! My name is Karinna , I'm a problem solver but also a maker.
    </div>
    <div class="selfDescription">
      A lover for technology and a logical thinker, I came with an architecture
      background where I had the pleasure to work for two years of my like,
      there I found out all the clients had the same problem, they want us to
      solve the flow of their house implementing their personality into their
      homes, working in there I developed the sense of measurements and colors,
      fascinated to use AutoCAD and Sketch up.
      <br /><br />
      I found out architecture was not my thing and I wanted more, moved to
      America for a new challenge in my life, and emerged myself into a Computer
      Information System college, became the first person in my family to earn
      an American college degree and discover new skills, I was solving
      problems, with combination of my past career in Architecture helped me to
      get where I am today, took the advantage I was learning HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript and implemented my design mindset into my softwares and my
      logical thinker to propagate the most efficient way to complete the tasks.
      Everything I have done, small or big, has been a vital stepping stone for
      where I am today.
      <br /><br />
      Known as NurVIX as well on the internet, in the beginning of Covid-19, I
      started my streaming channel that became much more than a Hobby, I
      involved my passion for tech with the love of making connections, I
      started playing videogame and end-up splitting my time coding with my
      community where we all share knowledge and push each other forward. With a
      lot of hard word and time invested, I grew a channel that reaches 3.500
      followers and was fortunate enough to build an awesome and supportive
      community all around the world.
      <br /><br />
      As a Jiu-jitsu lover, aside technology, I have a passion for marcial arts,
      It is a part of me where I learn everyday to be humble, respect and
      gratitude. Teaches me how to be resilient and always keep trying,
      efficiency and critical thinking. Constantly implementing these skills on
      my daily basis.
      <br /><br />
      You will probably hear me say a lot:
