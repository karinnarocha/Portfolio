            Hi! My name is Karinna , where Designing creativity meets
          </h2>
          <div class="selfDescription">
            I’m a designer, builder, and problem solver with a passion for
            creativity and innovation. My journey has been anything but
            traditional, and that’s what makes it so exciting.
            I started my journey in architecture, but life pushed me toward something bigger. I moved to the U.S., became the first in my family to earn an American degree, and discovered a passion for building, not just buildings, but ideas, brands, and digital experiences.
            <br><br>
            Over the years, I’ve created and launched projects that truly shaped my path:
            <br><br>
            -  Lulu & Remi — a children’s creative brand I designed the marketing and website from scratch, turning it into a successful Shopify e-commerce store reaching all USA in its first week.
            <br><br>
            -  NurVIX — my online persona and community, grown to over 3,500 followers, where I connect through gaming, coding, and creativity.
            <br><br>
            -  AI Live Translation Tool, a simple but powerful solution auto translate subtitle to what I say, between EN and PT, I built so my community around the world could follow my streams in real time.
            <br><br>
            -  Multiple client brands — helping companies grow through design, content, marketing, and clean digital experiences.
            <br><br>
            My background in architecture taught me design.
            <br><br>
            My career in tech taught me problem-solving.
            <br><br>
            And my love for Jiujitsu taught me resilience, discipline, and humility.
            <br><br>
            Every project, every challenge, and every step I’ve taken has built who I am today, someone who loves creating, helping others grow, and turning ideas into reality.
            <br><br>
            And as I always say…
            <br><br>
            “We got this!”
