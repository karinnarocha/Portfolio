      Hi! My name is Karinna , I'm a problem solver but also a maker.
    </div>
    <div class="selfDescription">
      A lover for technology and a logical thinker, I came with an architecture
      background where I had the pleasure to work for two years of my like,
      there I found out all the clients had the same problem, they want us to
      solve the flow of their house implementing their personality into their
      homes, working in there I developed the sense of measurements and colors,
      fascinated to use AutoCAD and Sketch up.
      <br /><br />
      I found out architecture was not my thing and I wanted more, moved to
      America for a new challenge in my life, and emerged myself into a Computer
      Information System college where I learned I could design different
      things, instead of designing homes, I was designing websites, the
      combination of my past career in Architecture helped me to get where I am
      today, took the advantage I was learning HTML/CSS so I started to do
      websites for free. Everything I have done, small or big, has been a vital
      stepping stone for where I am today.
      <br /><br />
      What I love about being a Software Developer is that I can put my critical
      thinking into game, I am capable of implementing my knowledge into
      practice where I can solve people's and my own problems and see the
      purpose of my creations.
      <br /><br />
      Developing a software is beyond just coding for hours, involves
      persistence on learning something new every day, and the passion of
      designs, whether with helping with marketing online, Learn about the
      customer and understand their needs and delivering solutions as quickly as
      possible, learning from those and then iterating and improving that value
      over time is the key to great product design.
